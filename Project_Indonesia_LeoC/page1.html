		<p>Above is famous Indonesian chef, William Wongso. He has made videos and food with Gordon Ramsey. The following was from a wikipedia article which perfectly encapsulates the accomplishments of Mr. Wongso's culinary career. William Wirjaatmadja Wongso (born 12 April 1947) is a culinary expert from Indonesia, specializing in Asian and European cuisine. He is the son of Soewadi Wongso (Wong See Hwa).

Wongso initially did not receive formal culinary training, but learned from sidewalk food vendors and eventually trained in pastry and baking with chefs at hotels in Indonesia.

In 1978, Wongso attended East Sydney Technical College for its baking program. In 1982, he attended Swiss Masters Bakers and Confectionery program in Lucerne, Switzerland, and then spent the following years of training in pastry, baking, chocolate, and ice cream in the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Italy until 1987.

Wongso intended originally to follow the in footsteps of his father and pursue a career in film and photography, but his father's hobby of cooking inspired his passion for the culinary arts.

In 2001, France's Ministry of Agriculture awarded Wongso the Chevalier dans l'Ordre National du Merite for his role in promoting French cuisine and gastronomy.

In 2008, Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla awarded Wongso the Professional Certification Authority (BNSP) for his dedication to culinary vocational education.

In 2009, the Korean Tourism Board named Wongso the Goodwill Ambassador for South Korea.</p>

		<div><p>The dish to the left is Gado-Gado. Gado-Gado is a traditional Indonesian salad made from a variety of fresh vegetables, boiled eggs, tofu, tempeh, and sometimes potatoes, all tossed in a rich, savory peanut sauce. The dish is known for its vibrant combination of textures and flavors, offering a balance of crispness from the vegetables, creaminess from the tofu and eggs, and a sweet, salty, and slightly spicy kick from the peanut sauce. Gado-Gado is often served as a main dish or side, providing a satisfying, nutritious meal with a delightful mix of savory, nutty, and tangy notes. It is commonly garnished with fried shallots or crackers for added crunch.</p></div>
