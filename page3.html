			<p>The general weather of Indonesia is usually sunny. The average temperature during the month of July is around 24째C to 32째C (75째F to 89째F) which is fairly beautiful for a nice summer day where the tourism is high. You should definitely take advantage of it if you plan on visiting for a vacation. While outside, you should go sightseeing at many tourist attractions, landmarks, historical sites and other amazing places. One particular instance is Prambanan Temple which can be seen to the left. However, be sure to check the weather in advance because Indonesia is highly prone to tsunamis because of its geographical location situated directly on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates frequently collide, causing frequent earthquakes which can trigger underwater displacements leading to tsunamis.</p>
